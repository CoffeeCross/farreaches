An ancient elven sorceress. She has little care for the Society and its operations, but cares a great deal about the study of the Reachesâ€™ history. Pathfinders working under her are generally tasked with uncovering ruins and recovering the artifacts of the ancestors that previously occupied the land. Many suspect her of using the Society as a means to headhunt disciples to join her coven.
