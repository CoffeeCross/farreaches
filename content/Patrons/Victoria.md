A human cleric of Abadar. She follows her gods word to the letter to the point itâ€™s hard to tell what are her desires and what are His. Abadar decrees that civilization be brought to the frontiers, and while it makes sense that a god of wealth would desire to recover the large orange gems hidden in the Reaches, she seems abnormally focused on the latter over the former. Pathfinders working under her are often mistaken for tomb raiders (or treasure hunters for those being nice about it).
